# MathJax - Right to Left Equations

This is a MathJax configuration to support right to left languages such as Arabic.

Run the demo:

    $ cd rtl_test
    $ make

Figure out the dependencies, but generally you need Node.js and BrowserSync installed.

The example will look like this:

**Note:** This is currently just a hack, suggestions pull requests are welcome :).

## Beautiful math in all browsers

MathJax is an open-source JavaScript display engine for LaTeX, MathML, and
AsciiMath notation that works in all modern browsers.  It was designed with
the goal of consolidating the recent advances in web technologies into a
single, definitive, math-on-the-web platform supporting the major browsers
and operating systems.  It requires no setup on the part of the user (no
plugins to download or software to install), so the page author can write
web documents that include mathematics and be confident that users will be
able to view it naturally and easily.  Simply include MathJax and some
mathematics in a web page, and MathJax does the rest.

Some of the main features of MathJax include:

- High-quality display of LaTeX, MathML, and AsciiMath notation in HTML pages

- Supported in most browsers with no plug-ins, extra fonts, or special
  setup for the reader

- Easy for authors, flexible for publishers, extensible for developers

- Supports math accessibility, cut-and-paste interoperability, and other
  advanced functionality

- Powerful API for integration with other web applications
