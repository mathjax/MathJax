 *
 *  MathJax/extensions/HTML-CSS/handle-floats.js
 *
 *  This extension allows HTML-CSS output to deal with floating elements
 *  better.  In particular, when there are tags or equation numbers, these
 *  would overlap floating elements, but with this extension, the width of
 *  the line should properly correspond to the amount of space remaining.
 *  
 *  To load it, include
 *  
 *      "HTML-CSS": {
 *        extensions: ["handle-floats.js"]
 *      }
 *  
 *  in your configuration.
